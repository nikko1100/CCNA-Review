1. Software-Defined Networking (SDN)

	The architecture of most network devices has three “planes”:

		Control plane - How does the router handles traffic and decides where to forward it.  
			//Traffic management and Forwarding DECISIONS
			ex. Spanning Tree Protocol, Border Gateway Protocol, Internet Control Message Protocol.
		
			The control plane handles traffic going TO the network device.
				
			The Control plane and Data plane are connected through an inband interface.
		
		Data plane - How does the traffic is actually forwarded. 
			//Forwarding ACTION
		
			The data plane handles traffic going THROUGH the network device. 

		Management plane - Provides management and applying of the configurations.
			ex. Simple Network Management Protocol, Secure Shell Protocol
		
			The management plane handles traffic going to the network device that is designed to configure, manage, or monitor the network device. 
			Put another way, management plane traffic can be qualified the same way as control plane traffic, but the purpose of the traffic is to configure, manage, or monitor the network device.
	
			*Distributed Control Plane - each devices have these three planes.
		
			R1 - SW1 - R2
	
			In a Software defined environment it is a good idea to have these planes isolated so you can segment and decide where does the traffic go (control plane) and how it os actually forwarded (data plane). 
				//think on the control plane as the traffic signs (where to go) and the data plane as cars and vehicules ( how do actually reaches destination). 
	
	
	SDN Controller - the Control Plane of devices are on the controller, centralizing the management of devices. 
		Application Programming Interface (API) - the communication between a controller and the devices. 
		//It is also considered as a Southbound Interface (SBI) because the devices being managed by the controller is South of the controller.
		
			//With the use of an SDN Controller, we now migrated from a Distributed Control Plane to a 
			*Centralized Control Plane.
		
			SDN Controller
			/     |    \
			R1 - SW1 - R2
		
			Southbound API: OpenFlow, OptFlex
		
		//With the existance of Southbound APIs, 
		we also have Northbound APIs.
		
		Northbound Interface: Applications 
			-REST APIs
				JSON, Py
		
			 Applications

			SDN Controller

			R1 - SW1 - R2
	
		
		//SDN in the world of Cisco
		Cisco APIC (Application Policy Infrastructure Controller): The SDN Controller that's part of Cisco's Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) solution for data centers.
		Cisco DNA (Digital Network Architecture) Center: Cisco's SDN Controller focused on Enterprise networks, that goes beyond traditional SDN by including intent.


	Wide Area Networks (WAN)
		Traditional WAN
	
						- Internet -

			CabModem	   10GFiber			   GiFiber
			/				  |						\
		[BLDG1] - MPLS - [DataCenter] - MetroNet - [BLDG2]
	
		-Connected remote sites back to a central site over various WAN tech.
		-Predictable Performance and security.
		-Traffic backhauling might be required.
	

		//In SDN Networking, applications are migrating to the cloud:
			AWS, Azure, Office, Dropbox
		
			-No backhauling required
			-Provide security, QoS and forwarding
		
				SD-WAN Overlay = Virtual Infrastructure
				Underlay Network = Physical Infrastructure

2. Software-Defined Access (SD-Access)
	//replacement for traditional Access-Control Lists (ACL)
	
	-Next-gen policy enforcement
	-Security Group Access Control Lists (SGACLs)
	-Policy are based on identity rather than address
	-Virtualization of physical network
	-Separate virtual networks can have separate policies
	
		Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE)
		-regardless where the user is connected, the SGACL policies still apply.

	SaaS (Software as a Service): SaaS uses the web to deliver applications that are managed by a third-party vendor and whose interface is
accessed on the clients' side. Most SaaS applications can be run directly from a web browser without any downloads or installations required,
although some require plugins.
