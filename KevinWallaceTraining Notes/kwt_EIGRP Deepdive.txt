EIGRP
Data Structure
1. Neighbor Table
2. Interface Table
3. Topology Table

Timers
1. Hello Interval 5s(Default)
2. Hold Timer     15(Default)
		15s		 ->	15s
		14s		|	14s
		13s		|	13s
		12s			...
		11s		A
		10s		|
		09s		|
		Hello!  |
	
	EIGRP Hold Time vs OSPF Dead Interval
		OSPF:  specifies how long local router waits for a Hello from an OSPF Neighbor. 				//I'll wait on you
		EIGRP: tells an EIGRP neighbor how long to wait before considering local router unavailable 	//You wait on me

Metric Calculation
(BDRLM) - Big Dogs Really Like Me
			*By Default - Only Bandwidth and Delay
B andwidth - based on the weakest link, (ex. from 1Gbps, 100Kbps, and 10Kbps, the 10Kbps is the least-bandwidth.)
			Formula
				Bandwidth (BW) = 10^7 / least-bandwidth
				Unit of Measure: Kbps
D elay
R eliability
L oad
M TU (Maximum Transmission Unit)
	
	Default K values:
		K1 = 1
		K2 = 0
		K3 = 1
		K4 = 0
		K5 = 0, if K5 = 0, K5/(K4 + reliability = 1)
		
	Full Formula
	Metric = {K1*BW +[(K2*BW)/(256-load)] + (K3*delay)]*[K5/(K4+reliability)]}*256

EIGRP Path Selection

	|-1gbps (1k cost)[R1]- 10k cost to R3
	|
10.1.1.0/24								-[R3]
	|
	|-1gbps (1k cost)[R2]- 5k cost to R3
	
	R3: 
		Neighbor: 				R1  &  R2
		Reported Distance(RD):	1K	   1k	Feasible Successor (Backup)
		Feasible Distance(FD):  11k	   6k - Successor (Lowest Cost)
			FD= RD + cost of route to get info
	
	Feasability Condition
		An EIGRP route is a feasible successor route if the RD from the neighbor is less than the FD of the successor route.

	EIGRP Query Process //the moment we run out of Feasible Successor Route//
		Stuck In Active - routers not recieving a packet because downstream routers are still waiting for further downstream router packets. //Damay Damay. 
						//Latest versions addressed this problem.
					after 90s: SIA Query, proactively ask the neighbor again for a response. - SIA Reply


	Router Config
	config t
		router EIGRP 1 //# is Autonomous System (AS) Number. Needs to match with neighbor EIGRP
		network 192.168.1.0 0.0.255 //advertise net add space. "Here's an add space. any int whose ip add fall within that add space, and it's up, advert that network."
		network 192.0.2.0 0.0.0.3 //conf connected network
		end

**
EIGRP Stub Routing
Routers that doesn't connect to other routers.

Stub options
1. connected 		- routers advert connected routes matched with a network //no query, but still advert
2. summary	 		- advert summarized routes
3. static	 		- advert static routes
4. leak-map name	- routers dynamic prefixes are based on leak-map
5. redistributed	- router advert redistributed routes
6. recieve-only		- stub router does not advert any routes

//turn router to a stub and stop hello packets from gig 0/1
config t
	router eigrp 1
	 eigrp stub connected
	 passive-interface gig 0/1 //no hello packets on gig 0/1 ,for security and performance purposes.
	 end

**
Load Balancing
	8by default, EIGRP will pick the best path, lowest metric.
	Balance traffic between successor and feasible successor. Instead of feasible successor waiting for successor to fail, it's going to work with it.

conf t
	router eigrp 1
	variance 2 //multiply feasible distance of successor by 2, anything (feasible distance)less than the product will be used.

**
Route Summarization
can be done on any router

//manual summary
conf t
 int gi 0/5
 ip summary-address eigrp 1//AS Number// 172.16.0.0 255.255.252.0
end

//auto summary - disadvantage: might summarize a mask that affects unwanted routes.
conf t
 router eigrp 1
 auto-summary
 end
